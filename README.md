my store house
hey there!!
Osahon Steve here, an eoectrical electronics engineer eager to venture into the world of coding without an iota of coding and programming knowledge. This, to me is more like making conversation with a girl you want to start a relationship with. After more than a decade out of engineering practice and into Banking, i feel like a lost sheep. I am hopeful that coding would be my saviour out of this doldrum. 
i am creative and adventurous
i hope to make breakthroughs in the world of coding
